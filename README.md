# Flag Clustering

This is my capstone project for my studies in Data Science with Digital Futures

## Project Aims

This is an explorational data science project which aims to find connections between flag designs in order to cluster them.
It is already known that many flags share designs with each other (Nordic cross, pan-Arab colours etc.) this project is my attempt to group them purely on flag design without external reference.
